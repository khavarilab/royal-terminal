# Royal Terminal ðŸ–¥
#### One app to bring all your connections and bind them ðŸª¢.


Royal TS is an app for Mac and Windows that supports different types of connections (SSH, SFTP, VNC and RDP).   
Benefits:
1. All connections are stored in a document (supports encryption), hence can be copied to different machines that you work on.
2. Store and automatically send passwords to initiate connection.
3. Store and automatically pass SSH keys.
4. Supports both VNC (remote desktop for Linux and Mac) and RDP (remote desktop for Windows).
5. Supports GUI for FTP and drag-and-drop functionality.

Coolest features: vertical tabs to work simultaneously across servers and an Overview of all active connections.   
**Like the movies, ðŸ«µ you too can feel like a hacker.**
